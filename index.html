            The Victoria Memorial is a huge limestone building in Kolkata, West Bengal, India, which was constructed
            within 1906 and 1921. It is sanctified to the representation of Queen Victoria and is now a gallery and
            traveler destination under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture.
            The monument lies on the Maidan by the cliff of the Hooghly River, which is near to the Jawaharlal Nehru
            Road. Every year thousands of people come to tour this gallery. In January 1901, on the demise of Queen
            Victoria, The 1st Baron Curzon of Kedleston and later Viceroy of India proposed the formulation of a fitting
            monument. Lord Curzon recommended the establishment of a monumental structure with a foundation and gardens.

            There are some really enchanting bays in the entire world! Bay is basically a stretch of land near a large
            water body. And isn't India lucky to be surrounded by one of the most bewitching bay, the Bay of Bengal?
            Yes, it's a triangular shaped beautiful bay that touches some parts of our country, Sri Lanka, Andaman
            Nicobar, and Bangladesh. And naturally where there is such a wonderful coastline, the existence of pristine
            beaches is mandatory.
            Beaches are a fabulous destination to unwind. No matter if you are looking for a relaxed soft surface, a
            seducing ambience to charm you up, or a rushing sea to let you feel alive, you'll get all these (and more)
            at the beaches. And we are talking about heading to some of the beguiling beaches, then why not try visiting
            the beaches of Bay of Bengal? We are sure you'll bless us for bringing up this idea!
